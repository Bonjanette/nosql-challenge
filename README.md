# nosql-challenge
Module 12 Challenge CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp

For this challenge, the 2 Jupyter Notebooks, 'NoSQL_setup' and 'NoSQL_analysis' are located in this folder. The Resources folder contains the 'establishments.json' file holding the data used.

ChatGPT was used for debugging. It was particularly useful for explaining why there is a need to place query results into lists. This topic was also covered in class.
